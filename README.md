This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: improper cleanup of timers. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from not using the return value of `setTimeout` to properly clear the timer when the component unmounts or the dependency array changes, leading to potential memory leaks and unexpected behavior.  The solution showcases the correct way to handle cleanup using the return value as a cleanup function.
